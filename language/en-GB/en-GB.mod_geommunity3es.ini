MOD_GEOMMUNITY3ES_XML_DESCRIPTION="Welcome to the Map module settings of the Geommunity3 Suite. This module loads a map from the Geommunity3 component with Ajax. It loads markers and infowindows with ajax to offer the best results in terms of performances on crowded maps. It offers various dynamic filters on map such as integration types (users, groups, photos, albums, kml etc...) Profile Types, and one of the Profile Custom fields to be able to filter markers live on the page. When hovering the option, related markers bounce, when unchecking the checkbox, they vanish. It also provides an address search and an autocomplete marker search. Markers can be displayes using clustering , and markers with the exact same location would show inside one unic infowindow."
